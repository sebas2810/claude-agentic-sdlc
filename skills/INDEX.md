# Principal Skills — the model

A **Principal skill** is a domain operating standard the engineer seat *embodies* while delivering an EPIC — the *bar* it holds itself to when the work touches that domain, not a persona to summarise. One engineer, one EPIC, but the standard it executes against shifts with the surface it touches. Skills operationalise the spine ([`../agentic-operating-model.md`](../agentic-operating-model.md)): the spine is the *why*, a skill is the *floor* for a given domain.

## The shape of a skill

Every Principal skill is one markdown file with:

- `## Identity` — the standard, in one paragraph
- `## When the engineer embodies this` — the surfaces that trigger it
- `## Operating standard` — the bar held as the floor
- `## Hard rules & refusals` — non-negotiables; what the skill refuses
- `## Decision checklist` — falsifiable Y/N checks run before any "ready" signal (a failed check is a blocker, not a note)
- `## Bundled eval (ADR-0001)` — the falsifiable eval the skill ships (or honestly `status: TBD`)

Skills are **composable** — an infra EPIC may need two at once (e.g. AWS Architect + a privacy standard); review against all that govern the surface.

## Add your own skill

Skills are **extensible** and **seat-agnostic** — any seat (engineer, PM, or a future specialist) embodies the ones its work needs:

1. **Copy the template** — [`SKILL.template.md`](SKILL.template.md) (the Agent Skills `SKILL.md` shape: `name` + `description` frontmatter + the Principal sections).
2. **Fill it in** — the domain's operating standard, hard rules, and a falsifiable decision checklist. The `description` is the trigger; make it precise.
3. **Register it** in your instance's catalog (the reference instance's is `instance/orbis/skills/INDEX.md`) — drop the file under `instance/<you>/skills/` and add a row.
4. **Embody it** — a seat (engineer or PM) composes the matching skill(s) per EPIC; more than one can govern a surface.

The format is the official **Agent Skills** standard ([anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)), so a skill written here is portable to Claude Code, Claude.ai, and — via a runtime loader — your AgentCore product agents. Anthropic also ships a **`skill-creator`** skill that scaffolds + lints a new `SKILL.md` — `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills` and use it to author yours faster. And where an official Anthropic skill fits the domain, **reference it rather than reinventing** (e.g. `webapp-testing`, `mcp-builder`, `claude-api`). Add a skill **when a seat actually builds in that domain**, not before.

## Your instance's concrete skills

The framework defines the *model*; each instance provides its own concrete skills. **The reference instance's five live in `instance/orbis/skills/`.** A fork adds its own under `instance/<you>/skills/`.

## Honest-eval discipline

Never treat "skill exists" as "skill is eval-backed" — that is the false-green failure (#985) these standards exist to prevent. A skill without its bundled discriminating eval is marked `status: TBD (follow-up)`, not silently presented as done.
